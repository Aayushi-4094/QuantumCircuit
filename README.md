**Title: Quantum Bell State Circuit Simulation using Cirq**

**Description:**
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the creation and simulation of a Bell state circuit using the Cirq quantum computing framework. The Bell state circuit is a fundamental concept in quantum computing, representing an entangled state between two qubits. The script defines a simple Bell state circuit, applies Hadamard and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates to create entanglement, simulates the circuit using a quantum simulator, and displays the final state vector.

**Instructions:**
1. ***Install Cirq:*** Make sure you have Cirq installed in your Python environment. You can install it via pip:
   ```
   pip install cirq
   ```

2. ***Run the Script:*** Execute the provided Python script in your preferred Python environment. This will create and simulate the Bell state circuit, displaying the final state vector.

**Output:**
Upon running the script, you should see the Bell state circuit displayed, followed by the final state vector after simulation.
